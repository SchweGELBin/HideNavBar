## Disclaimer
- If the module itself works but an specific option doesn't work, it's likely due to ROM incompatibility (while you may report such bugs, i can't guarantee they'll be fixable)
- GSI compabitility isn't guaranteed due to Magisk's inconsistent GSI support
- Automatic navbar coloring doesn't work on Android 11+ (Enabling Gcam fix MAY solve the issue but it's not guaranteed)
